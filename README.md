This is a portfolio that shows my work in CSS and also has my contact information.

The grid I made to display my work isnt quite working yet my old method for putting text
over an image with position:relative; and position:absolute; does not work with CSS grids I 
tried to google a fix for this but I dont know exactly what to search for
